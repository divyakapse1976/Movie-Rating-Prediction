# Movie Rating Prediction

This project predicts movie ratings based on various features such as
year of release, duration, genre, votes, director, and lead actors.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate a
movie’s IMDb rating.

Project Objective
To develop a regression model that predicts movie ratings using
historical movie data and machine learning techniques.

Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Exploration  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Encoding  
5. Train-Test Split  
6. Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)  
7. Model Evaluation  
8. Sample Prediction  

Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
